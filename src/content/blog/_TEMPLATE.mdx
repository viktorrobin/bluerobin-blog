## Introduction

[Contextual Hook]: Start with the "Why". Why does this technology or pattern matter in a modern distributed system? Avoid generic definitions. Relate it to challenges like scale, maintainability, or security.

**Why [Topic] Matters:**

- **Benefit 1**: Explanation of benefit.
- **Benefit 2**: Explanation of benefit.
- **Benefit 3**: Explanation of benefit.

### What We'll Build

In this guide, we will implement [Specific Solution]. You will learn how to:

1. **Objective 1**: e.g., Configure the service...
2. **Objective 2**: e.g., Implement the interface...
3. **Objective 3**: e.g., Deploy with resiliency...

## Architecture Overview

[Educational Context]: Before code, explain the design. Use a diagram to show how pieces fit together.

```mermaid

    User -->|Action| ComponentA
    ComponentA -->|Event| ComponentB
    subgraph System
        ComponentB --> Database
    end
```

## Section 1: Core Concept/Configuration

Explain the first major concept.
